We are using a delay of 500 msec on input in the last empty field before triggering validation. Those 500 msec are too short for inexperienced users and it will be hard to determine a right timeout here. Instead, I would like to work based on the question whether we are expecting a second digit in the last field or not. If we do not expect a second digit, trigger validation right after the first input. If we do expect a 2nd digit, allow for up to 1 second delay, but trigger validation immediately on submission of the 2nd digit.
