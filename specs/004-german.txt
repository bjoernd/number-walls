I would like to see any text on the website in German. Instead of Right say Richtig. Instead of Wrong say Falsch.

For the validation feedback, I would actually like to use a list of synonyms and pick a random one every time.

Synonyms for Richtig: Gut Super Toll Prima Klasse Genau
Synonyms for Falsch: Nee Achwas "Stimmt nicht" "Nicht ganz" "Schau genauer hin"
