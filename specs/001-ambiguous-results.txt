Depending on which fields we decide to clear, there may be situations where the solution is ambiguous.

Example: given this setup:

     _
   _   3
 _   1  2

A, D, and F are unknown and filled by the user. There are multiple valid assignments that suit the challenge, such as:

A=2 D=3 F=6
A=5 D=6 F=9

In this situations, we need to accept all possible valid answers instead of relying on our precomputed answer.
